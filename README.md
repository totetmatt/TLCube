# TLCube

Tool to manipulate set of images as texture3d with fragment shader.

## Example

## Installation 
Download binaries for Windows.
Run the Exe.

Maybe one day cross compilation in Linux and MacOs I promise.
## Usage

Default configuration will looks for `<your-user-home>/tlcube` file that have this pattern  `0001.jpg`

## ToDo (maybe one day :p ) 

* Integrated ui to modify shader (is it really needed ?)
* Export result as Image / Video / Gif
* Better Texture Loader
